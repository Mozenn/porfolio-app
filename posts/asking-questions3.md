## The context

It has been 6 months since I have started my internship at Lyra Network as a software engineer, and 3 months since my internship turned into a real software engineering job. In this period, you are expected to know little or nothing about the job, and thus, asking questions is mandatory. I would like to share some hints that I have picked up during this period.

## Why asking questions is hard and why you should do it

Asking questions is not easy.

First, It shows that we don't know something, and usually, we don't like not knowing something, especially in a work environment where we are evaluated on our performance and our expertise.

One of the problems with asking questions is that the period where you should ask lots of questions (ie when you enter a new work environment) is when you are the least comfortable doing so.

The number of questions you ask should be inversely proportional to your knowledge about a specific topic.

SCHEMA

**The more you know, the least questions you need to ask**

But you also have to avoid the trap of not asking any questions because you are supposed to know the topic and be an expert.

And that brings us to another pain point about asking questions :

**It is easier to ask questions when you are expected to**

As an intern or even a junior software engineer, you are expected to ask questions, so people might be more willing to answer, and your ego is not damaged, because you are okay not knowing. But the task becomes harder when you are more experienced and you are supposed to know your stuff. Imposter syndrome might start to kick in, and you start thinking that your new coworkers will find out that you are a fraud ... or you might not care and ask the question anyway. In this case, good for you.

**Asking questions is a two-way exchange**

Asking questions is beneficial for you because you benefit from years of experience in a matter of minutes in the form of your coworkers. Completing a task could take days if you try to complete it by yourself, but only a few hours if you ask for starting point before starting. In this case, you saved yourself some time and you also saved your company some money, because yes, you are paid to get the job done, not to be a superhero that completes every task by himself without any help.

On top of that, having a newcomer that asks interesting questions is a real asset for a team, because it can highlight problems only a newcomer can see.

For example, if you start working on an issue, but you spend an entire day looking for more details and asking multiple people about the process, it could mean that the description was not detailed enough, or that the documentation is lacking.

What you have to do in this situation is write down what you have learned, and create a new documentation page on your documentation tool of choice, so that the next person facing the same issue can benefit from it.

This process is way easier to apply when the company you are in has adopted a growth culture and people around you see the benefit of learning and improving bit by bit.

## How to ask questions

So how to ask questions then you might ask? Here are some tips :

**Ask the right questions**

The questions you need to ask are the ones that you feel you will have a hard time figuring things out by yourself, and getting help might save you hours or days of work.

Do not be lazy. If it is possible to get the answer, even if it is hard, you should try that first. On top of that, you learn more effectively when you are struggling compared to when you get the answer right away.

**Choose the right moment**

You need to understand the context you are in. Some moments are more appropriate than others.

If you have a question on a low-priority task, and your coworker is struggling with an urgent task that needs to be done today, you might better write it down and ask it at a later moment.

On the contrary, daily stand up are a great moment to ask questions. Everyone is here and they are listening to you! ( they should be ). But be aware not to take too much time, and continue the discussion afterward if there are still things that need to be tackled.
